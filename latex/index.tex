\mbox{\hyperlink{classApothesis}{Apothesis}} is a generalized kinteic Monte Carlo Code for tackling realistic deposition porcesses and more specificaly Chemical Vapor Deposition (C\+VD) and Atomic Layer Deposition (A\+LD) processes. It is developed in C++ and it is disrtibuted under G\+NU license.\hypertarget{index_install_sec}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_install_sec}
Currently no special installations instructions are required. A simple \char`\"{}make\char`\"{} should create the executable \char`\"{}\+Apothesis\char`\"{}. The Makefile was generated with qmake but the qt libradies are excluded.
